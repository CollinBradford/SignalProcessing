Alright, here are the project notes.  This is where I will put notes and documentation about the project, especially the 
schematic design where comments are not supported very well.  

I am currently working on redesigning the test modules.  The system involves a multiplexer that selects input from a
different source.  The address space is as follows: 

Multiplexer Address:

X = data input select

00000500 0000000000000XXX

000 = NTB (Name That Bit)
001 = OIA (One Is All)
010 = Sawtooth Wave
011 = 
100 = 
101 = 
110 = 
111 = ADC INPUT

Psudo Input Configuration:

These bits set up the selected psudo input.  What each register does depends on the psudo input mode that is selected.  

00000600 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

X = As Defined Below:

NTB:

Name That Bit allows you to set each input bit indivisually.  

00000000DDCCBBAA

AA = Rising Sample One
BB = Rising Sample Two
CC = Falling Sample One
DD = Falling Sample Two

OIA:

One Is All allows you to set one number that is set for each sample.  

00000000000000XX

X = Sample Value
