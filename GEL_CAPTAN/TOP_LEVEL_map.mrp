WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFG symbol
   "XLXI_5952" (output signal=CLK_187_5) has a mix of clock and non-clock loads.
   The non-clock loads are:
   Pin I1 of XLXI_6004/I_36_8
WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFG symbol
   "XLXI_5993" (output signal=CLK_375) has a mix of clock and non-clock loads.
   The non-clock loads are:
   Pin I2 of XLXI_6004/I_36_8
WARNING:Place:644 - A clock IOB clock component is not placed at an optimal
   clock IOB site. The clock IOB component <SECONDARY_CLK> is placed at site
   <AF7>. The clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock
   buffer/GCLK if the IOB is placed in the master Clock IOB Site. This is
   normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on
   COMP.PIN <SECONDARY_CLK.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This
   constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.
   The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor
   timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in
   the design.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 126 block(s) removed
 475 block(s) optimized away
  65 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
