WARNING:Place:644 - A clock IOB clock component is not placed at an optimal
   clock IOB site. The clock IOB component <SECONDARY_CLK> is placed at site
   <AF7>. The clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock
   buffer/GCLK if the IOB is placed in the master Clock IOB Site. This is
   normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on
   COMP.PIN <SECONDARY_CLK.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This
   constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.
   The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor
   timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in
   the design.

NOTE:
The above detailed report is the initial placement of the logic after the clock region assignment. The final placement
may be significantly different because of the various optimization steps which will follow. Specifically, logic blocks
maybe moved to adjacent clock-regions as long as the "number of clocks per region" constraint is not violated.
